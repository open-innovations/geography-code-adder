# Geography Code Adder

Add UK GSS geography codes to CSV files that only contain names

The data come from the ONS's [Code History Database (July 2024) for the UK](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/d7be63c8bd144ae0a26c6593eb5e00b7/about) and are split by the first three characters of the GSS code e.g. `E14`.
